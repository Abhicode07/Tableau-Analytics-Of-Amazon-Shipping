# Amazon Shipping Analytics

###  Overview 

Amazon Shipping is a company which ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) all over the world.

The Shipping Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are processed and shipped on a monthly basis.
He would like a dashboard of this where he selects a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be shipped.

He has given us csv files from which we have to create a Dashboard for his quick review so that he could take further decisions for the benefit of the company.

Thus, we created below interactive dashboard as per his requirement. Now, he could switch and view different shipping stats for different months and years.
